           This page is about my hobbies and things I do during my leisure time. In admist of busy college schedule and assignment deadlines, I manage to make free time for myself. During such free time, I usually play games and play instruments. <a class = "basic" href = "http://blog.dota2.com/?l=english">DOTA2</a> and <a class = "basic" href = "https://clashroyale.com/">ClashRoyale</a> are the top played games by me. DOTA2 has always been my most favourite game. I played it since I was in grade eight. Short for "Defence of the Ancients 2", DOTA2 is a MOBA(miltiplayer online battle arena) in which we pick heroes with their own skills and attributes and play with others. This game requires high calculation knowledge and good predicting skills. To become a good dota player one should have quick reflexes and be able to take the best judgment decisions. DOTA2 has a yearly tournament called 'The Internationals" or TI for short. The last TI was TI9 in the August and the prize pool was $30 million which is the highest prize pool for a single e-sports event.
