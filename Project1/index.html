           Hello Everyone. I am Nirakar Shrestha and this is my HTML web
           page project. This page is all about my basic information. I was born in Bhaktapur, Nepal on 15th of February, 1999.I have a twin brother who is just seven minutes younger than me. With him, I  spent my childhood in a small town called Thimi. At the age of 10, my family moved to Gatthaghar. I studied in Mt. Sinai English Baording School till grade three. After that, I went to Budhanilkantha School where I completed my highschool degree. After my highschool I took a year gap and decided to go to th U.S. for my undergraduate. Currently, I am Sophomore in Caldwell Univeristy. It is located in Caldwell, New Jersey. The university is populated by large number of Nepalese students. In a way, it still feels like Nepal, here in Caldwell University. My major is Computer Science and this project is for my Emerging Technologies Course. Mr. <a class = "basic"  href = "https://www.facebook.com/arnold.toffler" >Arnold Toffler </a> is our professor for this course.
        </p>
        
        My aim in life is to be a software developer. Though much progress has been seen in software sector, the vastness of software engineering hasnot been completely discovered yet. There is much more yet to be found and done through the art of software engineering. By mastering the skill of programming, I believe I can develop much more advanced softwares for  fields like education, banking and healthcare. These fileds still lack the best version of software technology. The pinnacle of software development is still to be rewached and that is where I want to contribute. A good software makes our life easy but the best software would change the way of our life. Believing this, I am hwading forward to become a professional programmer and devote my time as software engineer.
